# 1. How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I follow a structured approach that includes:
  # Understanding Requirements: 
I begin by gathering and analyzing the requirements to clearly understand 
what needs to be achieved.
  # Planning and Prototyping: 
I outline the design, create prototypes, and plan how the components will fit together. 
This helps in visualizing the end product and identifying potential issues early.
  # Iterative Design: 
I build initial versions, test them, and gather feedback. 
This iterative process allows me to refine the design based on real-world usage and feedback.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs?
In developing programs, my approach involves:
   # System Design: 
I design a clear and structured architecture that outlines how different parts of the program 
will interact.
   # Modular Coding: 
I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and modular code. This involves breaking down the
code into reusable functions and modules.
   # Testing and Refinement: 
I continuously test and debug the code to ensure it meets the requirements and performs as expected. 
This iterative refinement helps in catching and fixing issues early.

# 3. How has this project influenced my approach and future work?
  # Design Skills: 
The project enhanced my ability to create realistic 3D models, apply textures effectively, and manage
lighting and camera controls. I learned how to design modular and reusable components.
  # Development Strategies: 
I adopted modular coding practices and dynamic texturing techniques. Feedback became 
integral to refining the final product, leading to better-quality results.
   # Future Application: 
The skills and strategies developed through this project will be valuable in future projects,
whether in creating more complex 3D environments or working on different software development tasks. 
These approaches will improve efficiency and enhance the quality of my work.
